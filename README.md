### Hey, it's Aarav: ğŸ‘“ğŸ§ªğŸ¤–
I'm an app developer who makes apps in Swift, Thunkable, Flutter, and Python. I've designed websites on request and use my programming knowledge in the scientific world. I've applied what I've learned to. A select few of my works are available for study and review here. If you have any queries, comments, requests, or business-related affairs, feel free to send an email!
