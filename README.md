### Hey, it's Aarav: ðŸ‘“ðŸ§ªðŸ¤–
I'm an app developer who makes apps in Swift, Thunkable, Flutter, and Python. I've designed websites on request and use my programming knowledge in the scientific world. A select few of my works are available for study and review here. If you have any queries, comments, requests, or business-related affairs, feel free to send an email!
